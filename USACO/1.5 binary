Summary

In summary, these operators enable setting, clearing, toggling, and testing any bit or combination of bits in an integer:

		a |= 0x20;		/* turn on bit 0x20 */
		a &= ~0x20;		/* turn off bit 0x20 */
		a ^= 0x20;		/* toggle bit 0x20 */
		if (a & 0x20) {
			/* then the 0x20 bit is on */
		}
    
    a << n        /* shift a left n bits
	  a >> n        /* shift a right n bits
  
  Consider a
five-bit binary number like 00110. If that number is shifted one
bit left, it becomes: 01100. On the other hand, if 00110 is shift
one bit to the right, it becomes 000011.
